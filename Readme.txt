Hakuna Matata (Code.Fun.Do IIT Guwahati, Team oldmonk)

Hakuna Matata is an app build to notify you of all the upcoming events in the campus thus saving your time in
searching different facebook pages or groups about an event.
Not everyone can post an event in the app, therefore securing it from fake posts.
A person needs to register first and get approval from the admins before signing in. 
Only admins can post an event and approve other designated persons of the campus who further become 
a part of the admin community.

After signing in, one can post event in the app by providing the details of the event.
